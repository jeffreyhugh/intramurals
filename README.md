# Starter

## Purpose

[Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence) built an awesome Next.js/TailwindCSS [starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter), but I wanted to add some features and tweak some others.

## Features

The full list of features is on [starter.jh.ms/features](https://starter.jh.ms/features), but here's a quick rundown:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- DaisyUI
- Supabase (with auth helpers)
- MDX
- React Hot Toast
- Open Graph
- Code Snippets
- Opinionated CSS Utility Classes
- Custom Anchor Tags
- Prettier
- Drone CI Lint and Deploy
- Conventional Commits

Plus most everything else in Theodorus Clarence's starter.
